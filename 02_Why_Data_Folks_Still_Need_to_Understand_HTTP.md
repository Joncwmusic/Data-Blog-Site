# Why Data Scientists Still Need to Know About HTTP

Data scientists, data analysts, data engineers, and... the business analysts still stuck in their spreadsheets *ick* come from all kinds of backgrounds. Some data scientists and engineers are former software engineers
that realize they're better suited to moving numbers around than designing a functional UI. Meanwhile others had a better time studying mathematics and gagged everytime they picked up a TI-83
while they hand wrote their proofs before begrudgingly transfering their writings into a `LaTeX`.
Now you might know some basic SQL and python and might've vibe coded your way through the last 2 years with a scripts that your real software engineer colleagues have openly laughed at.

But now you're trying to skill up and that might mean learning a thing or two about how some of the internet actually works. After all, your servers are cloud based,
your data pipelines are based on a deprecated API endpoint barely holding on, and every time you use chatgpt you're still amazed your computer is doing that. 
(spoiler: *your* computer is not the one giving you an answer when you ask chatgpt "How make data go brrrr.")

So let's talk about HTTP (and it's better sibling, HTTPS)
